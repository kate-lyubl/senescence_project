Advancements in medical science have improved the lives of individuals with diseased or injured organs. However, organ transplantation from donors has limitations, including the time-consuming search for suitable donors and the risk of organ rejection. Regenerative medicine offers a promising alternative by developing biological substitutes to restore and maintain normal tissue function.

Regenerative medicine combines cell transplantation, material science, and bioengineering [1]. It utilizes native targeted progenitor cells and stem cells, which can be transplanted and differentiated into specialized cell types [1,2]. Biomaterials serve as scaffolds to support tissue growth [1].

Various human cells, such as somatic, adult stem, and embryo-derived cells, are central to regenerative medicine. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are particularly versatile, with the ability to differentiate into various cell types and promote cell migration and angiogenesis [3]. MSCs can be obtained from multiple adult tissues, including the endometrium.

Endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) are clonogenic cells derived from the endometrium, a regenerative tissue in women. These cells can be easily extracted from an endometrial biopsy or menstrual blood [4]. eMSCs have shown potential for regenerative medicine applications, promoting host cell survival and proliferation [4].

Cellular senescence is a challenge in regenerative medicine, especially in stem cell-based therapies. Senescence occurs when proliferating cells encounter damage, stress, or extreme short telomeres, leading to a stable cell cycle arrest and the activation of a secretory phenotype. Various markers define cellular senescence, and their presence may vary depending on the specific cellular culture [5].

This study focused on senescence in eMSCs analyzed transcriptome data from different stages of cultivation. The findings showed that eMSCs exhibited transcriptomic characteristics of senescence after one month of cultivation, despite remaining proliferative. Several cellular pathways were significantly altered, including selenocysteine metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of cell cycle proteins, extracellular matrix organization, and DNA repair.

These findings have important implications for the therapeutic potential of eMSCs and highlight limitations in their application for regenerative medicine. The study also contributes to understanding stress-induced senescence and the mechanisms involved in this process.
